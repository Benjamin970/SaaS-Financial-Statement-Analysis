# SaaS-Financial-Statement-Analysis

### Project Overview
This project focuses on the financial analysis of a Software as a Service (SaaS) company by comparing actual versus budgeted performance across key financial metrics. Using Excel for data cleaning and preprocessing, and Power BI for data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard creation, the analysis delivers a comprehensive view of the companyâ€™s revenue trends, expense management, and profitability. The project highlights variances in operating expenses, gross profit, net profit, and total revenue, enabling deeper insight into financial performance. Visual storytelling through dashboards provides stakeholders with clear, actionable insights to support strategic planning and decision-making.
